# Introduction {#Introduction}

Servus is a small C++ network utility library that provides a zeroconf
API, uri parsing and UUIDs.

Servus 1.2 can be retrieved by cloning the
[source code](https://github.com/HBPVIS/servus). Please file a
[Bug Report](https://github.com/HBPVis/servus/issues) if you find any issues
with this release.

## Features {#Features}

Servus provides classes for:

* 128 bit UUIDs.
* A URI class to parse strings using generic syntax from [RFC3986](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt).
* Zeroconf announcing and browsing using Avahi or DNSSD. This is an optional
  feature available only if the dependencies are found.

# Building {#Building}

Servus is partially cross-platform, the only mandatory dependency is using
a C++11 compiler. Zeroconf will be available in those platforms were either
Avahi or DNSSD are available. Servus uses CMake to provide a
platform-independent build configuration. The following platforms and build
environments have been tested:

* Linux: Ubuntu 14.04, RHEL 6 using gcc 4.8.2
* Windows: 8 using Visual Studio 12
* Mac OS X: 10.9 and 10.10 using clang 6

The following external, pre-installed optional dependencies are required:

* Boost.Test to build unit tests.
* Avahi (avahi-client) or DNSSD for zeroconf.
* Qt5 Core for servus::qt::ItemModel.
* Qt5 Widgets for servusBrowser tool.

To download and compile Servus from source:

~~~
