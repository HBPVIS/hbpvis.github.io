# Overview

Lexis is the vocabulary used for event-driven communication in and between
visualization software, mainly from the [BlueBrain](https://github.com/BlueBrain) and
[HBPVIS](https://github.com/HBPVIS) world. It provides various events and shared
objects which are implemented on top of
[ZeroBuf](https://github.com/HBPVIS/ZeroBuf).
